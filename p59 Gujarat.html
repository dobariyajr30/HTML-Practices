                <h3>About Gujarat</h3>
                <h4>
                    Gujarat is strategically located with India’s longest coastline of 1,600 kms and acts as a natural
                    gateway to the rich land-locked northern and central hinterland. Gujarat is renowned for its
                    beaches, temples towns, historic capitals, wildlife sanctuaries, hill resorts, sculptures,
                    handicrafts, arts and festivals.

                    Gujarat is one of the most diverse States in India. Its history stretches over a long years from the
                    age old Harappa Civilization to the Mughal period. Gujarat’s endless journey from roots to wings is
                    timeless with historical and cultural traditions glorifying the State. The diverse and vibrant state
                    of Gujarat has a significant contribution to the cultural aspect of India. The sheer simplicity and
                    amiability of Gujarati’s have made them a flourishing community. The state of Gujarat boasts a
                    vibrant art, architecture, culture, and heritage; all of which is quite evident in the day-to-day
                    lives of the locals. The diversity exhibited by Gujarat is a result of the various ethnic groups
                    constituting Gujarat’s population; including Indic and Dravidian groups.

                    Gujarat has and continues to be the pride of India from an economic, cultural and social development
                    perspective. It is recognized for its vibrancy and entrepreneurial spirit. It is one of India’s
                    leading industrialized and assumes a pivotal role in the fast changing business dynamics of India to
                    meet the globalization drive.

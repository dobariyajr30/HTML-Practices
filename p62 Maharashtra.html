                <h3>About Maharashtra</h3>
                <h4>The most widely accepted theory among the linguistic scholars is that the words Maratha and
                    Maharashtra ultimately derived from a combination of Mahā (Marathi: महा) and Rāshtrikā (Marathi:
                    राष्ट्रिका),the name of a tribe or dynasty of chiefs ruling in the Deccan region.[29] An alternate
                    theory states that the term is derived from mahā ("great") and ratha/rathi ("chariot"/"charioteer"),
                    which refers to a skilful northern fighting force that migrated southward into the area.[</h4>
